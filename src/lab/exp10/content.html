Transition state calcuation for a simple organic chemistry reaction

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

       When two (especially organic) molecules approach each other,  there is a possibility of several different chemical reactions between them; each giving different products. Many reactions occur in a single step if the reactants collide with a suffucient energy and specific orientation to form a product. However, many reactions do not occur in a single step but follows multi-steps where it goes  through many intermediate levels in a half-way and finally leads to product. These  intermediate levels are known as transition states. Stabilisation of these transition states is very difficult because these are  highly energetic and unstable species. A chemical reaction may go through many transition states and ultimately leads to the product.The number of  transition states may be different for different reaction path ways for a chemical reaction. There are many different reaction path ways which leads to products from reactants example: Electrophilic reactions, Nucleophilic reactions etc

	During these reactions already existing bonds  will break and forms new bonds. SN2 is one of the mechanistic pathway where one nucleophile attacks the center of other molecule and forms the product. The elimination of leaving group and addition of attacking group takes place simultaneously.

<p>
These mechanisms depends on structure of the reactant and nucleiphile, the solvent, temperature.
SN2:
Let's consider transition state in  the reaction between iodomethane and chloride ion.

In the above  substitution reaction, the nucleophile Cl-  attacks the reactant iodomethane and forms a product chloromethane and  leaves I- as leaving group. The intermediatary state where  nucleophile Cl- forms bond and I- breaks bond with the  iodomethane  simultaneously is known as transition state.This mechanism is known as SN2 type and which is stereospecific i.e. Gives a product  inverse in configuration  with the reactant. Usually aprotic solvents like acetone, DMSO, DMF etc favours this reaction.

  <ol>
   <li> Select the reactants,transition state and the products to get the actual reaction which is under study. </li>
    <li>.The inputs of the SN2 reaction i.e., the iodomethane and the chloride ion's input files for GAMESS are considered and upon running GAMESS we get the respective output files i.e., the optimised structures for the inputs of the SN2 reaction. </li>
     <li>The TS of the SN2 reaction where the chloride ion and the iodide ion are bound to the methyl group is taken as input and upon running GAMESS the transition state is being found. (the TS state is verified upon looking at one imaginary frequency.) </li>
     <li> The output files i.e., the chloromethane and the iodide ion are being optimised using GAMESS. </li>
     <li> The energies of the reactants, transition states and the products are being tabulated. </li> 
     <li> The activation energy(i.e., the difference between the energy of the transition state and that of the reactants) and the reaction energy (i.e., the difference between the energy of the products and that of the reactants) are being calculated. </li>

Conformational analysis of 1,2-dichloroethane

<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes result from sigma overlap of two tetrahedral carbon sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. Due to this sigma bond symmetry, there is free rotation around the carbon-carbon single bond. The different spatial arrangements that a molecule can adopt due to rotation about a sigma bonds are called conformations and a specific structure is called a conformer (conformational isomer). Unlike other kinds of isomers, different conformers cannot usually be isolated, since they interconvert too rapidly.The study of the energy changes that occur during these rotations is called conformational analysis. The objective of conformational analysis is to identify the preferred conformations of a molecule, those conformations that determine its behaviour.

The strategy in conformational analysis is to use a search algorithm to generate a series of initial conformations. Each of these in turn is then subjected to energy minimisation in order to derive the associated minimum energy structure.
Systematic search is one way to generate the conformations. In Systematic search method conformations are generated by systematically assigning values to the torsion angles of the rotatable bonds in the molecule. Each torsion angle is restricted to a predetermined set of possible values. Each initial structure is then energy minimized and the stable conformations are enumerated. The advantage of this method is that all the global and local minima will be found as long as the step-size in the torsional angle is not too large. The “difficulty” of a systematic search can be related to the number of structures to be energy minimized. For linear acyclic systems, the difficulty is 6N where N is the number of flexible torsions present. systematic methods are very difficult to apply to molecules with more than 7 or 8 flexible torsional angles because the number of initial structures generated becomes enormous and the amount of CPU time to energy minimize each becomes prohibitive.
The other methods for conformational analysis are Random search method, Distance Geometry.

  <h2>Manual</h2>
  <ol> 
    <li>  Select the molecule under study and view the z-matrix for the molecule. </li>
    <li>  The gamess input file will be displayed with the required options like RUNTYP=RSURFACE, IFZMAT=3,7,4,1,8 for the conformational search along the Cl-C-C-Cl dihedral (denoted by 7, 4, 1, 8 atoms in the molecule) angle.</li>
    <li>  Upon clicking rungamess the output file for the same would be generated which contains the energy at each specified dihedral angle. </li>
    <li>  The energy thus generated is in Hartrees. Next slide contains a table where the energy values at the specified dihedrals are to be filled in kcal/mol.</li>
    <li>  By taking these energy and dihedral values, the plot for the energy Vs dihedral looks as shown in the next slide. </li>
   <li>  Upon clicking on the plot at various dihedrals, the conformation at that particular dihedral is being displayed. </li>
   <li>  All the conformations for the analysis are being played alongside of the graph to show the various possible conformations. </li>
